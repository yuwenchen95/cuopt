def Solve(data_model, solver_settings=None, session=None):
    """
    Solve the Linear Program passed as input and returns the solution.

    Data Model object can be construed through setters
    (see linear_programming.DataModel class) or through a MPS file
    (see cuopt.linear_programming.Read function)


    Notes
    -----
    Both primal and dual solutions are zero-initialized.
    For custom initialization, please refer to `set_initial_primal_solution()`
    and `set_initial_dual_solution()` methods.
    For more details on the Solution object, see linear_programming.Solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_model : DataModel
        Data model containing a representation of a linear program on standard
        form.
    solver_settings: SolverSettings
        Settings to configure solver configurations.
        By default, it uses default solver settings to solve.
    session: PyCapsule, optional
        Reuse capsule ``cuopt.lp_solve_session`` from a prior barrier/QCQP solve
        (``Solution.lp_solve_session``).

    Returns
    -------
    solution: Solution
        Solution object containing both primal and dual solutions, objectives
        and more statistics about the result.

def BatchSolve(data_model_list, solver_settings=None):
    """
    Solve the list of Linear Programs passed as input and returns the solutions
    and total solve time.

    .. deprecated::
        LP BatchSolve is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
        It runs concurrent LPs in multiple C++ threads, which can be done
        independently in user code. Use sequential :func:`Solve` calls instead,
        e.g. ``[Solve(dm, solver_settings) for dm in data_model_list]``, or
        implement your own parallelism (e.g. ``concurrent.futures``).

    Data Model objects can be construed through setters
    (see linear_programming.DataModel class) or through a MPS file
    (see cuopt.linear_programming.Read function)


    Notes
    -----
    Solving in batch is usually faster than solving one by one.
    The total time to solve the whole batch on the engine side is returned as
    summing up the solutions `get_solve_time` would be incorrect as they are
    solved together in parallel, overlapping multiple solve.
    Both primal and dual solutions are zero-initialized.
    For custom initialization, please refer to `set_initial_primal_solution()`
    and `set_initial_dual_solution()` methods.
    For more details on the Solution object, see linear_programming.Solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_models : list of DataModel
        Data models containing a representation of a linear program on standard
        form.
    solver_settings: SolverSettings
        Settings to configure solver configurations.
        By default, it uses default solver settings to solve.

    Returns
    -------
    solution: list of Solution
        List of Solution objects containing both primal and dual solutions,
        objectives and more statistics about the result.
    solve_time: double
        The engine solve time for the whole batch in seconds as a float64.
